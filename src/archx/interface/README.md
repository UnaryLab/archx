# Hardware interfaces

An interface is a pluggable cost model that prices a hardware module: given a module's `query` dict from the architecture YAML, it returns the module's metrics (area, leakage power, per-operation dynamic energy, ...).

A module selects its interface with the `interface:` key inside its `query` (usually inherited from the architecture's global `attribute`). At metric-population time, Archx imports `interface/<name>/<name>.py` and calls its `query` function.

## Bundled interfaces

- `cacti7/`: wraps the CACTI7 C++ memory model for SRAM/DRAM. Bundles the CACTI7 source under `include/cacti7/` plus `.cfg` templates. Binaries are stored per host as `cacti-<system>-<machine>` (`cacti-Linux-x86_64`, `cacti-Darwin-arm64`); the one matching the host is used, and built from source when absent.
- `cacti_fn/`: wraps FN-CACTI (PCACTI patched for FinFET / NC-FinFET, `include/cacti_fn/`) for scratch-RAM `sram` only. Supported `(technology, transistor, voltage)` combinations: 14 nm `finfet` at 0.2 to 0.8 V in 0.1 steps (default 0.7), 7 nm `finfet` at 0.45/0.30 V (default 0.45) or first-order scaled 0.7 V, 14 nm `cmos` at 0.80/0.55 V (default 0.80), and 22 nm `cmos` at 0.80 V. `transistor` defaults to `finfet`. Use `wire_technology: 7` for ASAP7 7 nm wires. XML paths select device and SRAM cell files by default; optional `device_file` and `sram_cell_file` override them with paths relative to `include/cacti_fn/`. The 14 nm FinFET path uses hardcoded data. Voltage interpolation is not supported. Same per-host binary scheme as `cacti7`.
- `csv_cmos/`: interpolates area/power/energy of logic modules from CMOS synthesis and place-and-route CSVs under `include/csv/`, characterized at 45 nm and 7 nm. `csv_cmos_extract.py` generates those CSVs from synthesis reports; see `csv_cmos/README.md`.
- `csv_cmos_32nm/`: the same lookup over a 32 nm library under `include/csv/`.
- `csv_cmos_asplos_2026_ae/`: the same lookup over the 45 nm library the `asplos_2026_ae` branch characterized, used by `zoo/mugi`.
- `chiplet_cmos/`: CMOS CSV lookup for chiplet-based designs (CSVs under `csv/`).
- `csv_sc/`: stochastic-computing module CSVs.
- `csv_h200/`: measured H200 power and runtime per GPU kernel.
- `csv_riscv/`: per-stage CSVs for a RISC-V core, reporting dynamic energy per instruction where a class lists several.

## Writing an interface

An interface is a directory `<name>/` containing `<name>.py` that defines:

```python
def query(name: str, interface: str, query: OrderedDict, input_dir=None, output_dir=None):
    ...
    return metric_dict
```

- `name`: the module name from the architecture.
- `query`: the module's query dict (interface key already stripped; global attributes such as `technology` and `frequency` merged in).
- Returns an OrderedDict of metrics. Each metric is either a single `{'value': ..., 'unit': ...}` entry, or a per-operation dict (e.g. separate `read`/`write` dynamic energy for an SRAM); the performance model then selects the operation via the `operation` key on a subevent edge.

Query results are cached in memory and on disk (under `$ARCHX_INTERFACE_CACHE_DIR`, defaulting to `~/.cache/archx/interface`), so repeated queries with identical parameters do not rerun the underlying model.

## Managing interfaces

```bash
archx -ireg  -iname <name> -idir <dir>   # register: copy <dir> into archx/interface/<name>
archx -iureg -iname <name>               # unregister: remove archx/interface/<name>
archx -icopy -iname <name> -idir <dir>   # copy an installed interface out to <dir>
```

Registration copies the directory into the installed package, so the interface travels with the `archx` installation rather than the calling project.
