    Examples:

DependencyGraph:

functionality
✅  - add each object manually (Arch, Event, Workload)
🟥  - add architecture instance by other instance(maybe dependency?)
✅  - add each object as a explicit config (Arch, Workload)
✅  - add each object as a iteration config (Arch, Workload)
🟥  - add each object as a direct dependency (instance, parameter, tag is supplied)
🟥  - add each object as a function of another object (Arch, Workload)
🟥  - add each dependency as a manual tag (Arch Workload)
🟥  - add each antidependency as a manual tag with default configuration
🟥  - add each object as a function of another object with antidependency (Arch, Workload)
🟥      - conditional, needs to match the dimensions passed.
🟥  - add conditional dependency 
🟥      - acts as dependency when condition met
🟥      - acts as anti where condition met
🟥      - else no dependency
🟥  - add performance to event as
✅      - path
🟥      - function ?
🟥  - what if they want to reuse an object from one design to another?
🟥  - add loggeru
🟥  - what if I want multiple workloads, archs tied dependent together?

Flow
- Add designs
- Create dependencies
- Expand iterations

Add designs

parameters:
    normal: not affected by iteration
    iteration: affected by iteration
    depth_iteration: structure where it is effected by internal iteration (query)
    dependencies: defines interation interaction (none, dependency, antidependency, conditional dependency)

helpers
    parent class:
        - add
        - remove
    child class (implicit by changing parameters)
        - update

typechecking at module for different options

Add dependencies

allow dependencies at 3 levels
    - across designs
    - within designs (workload <-> architecture)
    - within designs (workload <-> workload) || (architecture <-> architecture)

    handle dependency assertions and typechecking specific to dependencies

After dependencies built, now expand and iterate

no dependency: iterates on both dims
dependency: iterates together
antidependency: Do not iterate together
conditional dependency: Condition decides which 3 it is.
